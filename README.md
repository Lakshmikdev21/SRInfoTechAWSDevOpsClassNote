What is Git?

Git is a free, open-source version control system (VCS) that helps developers manage their code. It's the most widely used tool VCS(version control system) Git is fast for committing, branching, merging, and comparing past versions Git is very high Performance and Flexibility,Security

Install Git in you local machine

https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

Please download the ---64-bit Git for Windows Setup.

Once download the git .exe file , double click and install the git on your machine

once installed right click on your local machine you can found Open Git batch here option, means git is installed successfully in your machine

Github Introduction::
===============

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to store and manage their code in repositories.

Version Control: ::
GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code. This allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's contributions.

Repositories::: where you can store your project files and track the history of changes made to those files.Public and private repos can be created depending on accessibility needs.


git commands::
================

git commands::

---git clone <github repository url>

>git clone https://github.com/srinfotech7358/AWSDevOps.git

>git status

>git add --all

>git commit -m "added some text files to Readmefile"

>git push

if we get any Access denied issues during push the changes from local to remote repository,please be authenticate below commands

>git config --global user.name "srinfotech7358"

>git config --global user.email "srinfotechbatch1@gmail.com"



Generate SSHKeys:: to Integarte Git to Github
==============================================

syntax::ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"


>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "srinfotechbatch1@gmail.com"

Keys avaibale path and save the key (/c/Users/HP/.ssh/id_ed25519):

Github branching strategy::
===========================

A GitHub branching strategy is crucial for maintaining an organized workflow in version control. There are different strategies depending on the size of the project, the number of team members, and the desired workflow. Here are some common branching strategies used in GitHub:

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.03.17

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.03.17

hotfix branch:: always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes

bugfix:: this branch is created from release branch to fix the LLE(lower level environemnt)/Pre-Prod/UAT/Non-Prod issues and once LLE issues fixed ,we should pushed their changes to release branch only.
